Biologist with 15 years of experience in environmental regulations and species conservation transitioning to information technologies, specifically to Quality Assurance Engineering (QA). 

üöÄ I finished an intensive bootcamp where I gained hands-on experience in manual and automated testing for web, mobile, and API applications. 

‚úÖ I developed functional tests using techniques such as equivalence classes and limit values, ran endpoint validations with Postman, managed bugs in JIRA, and automated tests with Python and Pytest. 

üå± One of my achievements was to create a function in Python to automatically calculate percentages of environmental investment in a document system, integrating my previous knowledge with my new training in technology.
