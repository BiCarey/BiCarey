Biologist with 15 years of experience in environmental regulations and species conservation transitioning to information technologies, specifically to Quality Assurance Engineering (QA). I finished an intensive bootcamp where I gained hands-on experience in manual and automated testing for web, mobile, and API applications. I developed functional tests using techniques such as equivalence classes and limit values, ran endpoint validations with Postman, managed bugs in JIRA, and automated tests with Python and Pytest. One of my achievements was to create a function in Python to automatically calculate percentages of environmental investment in a document system, integrating my previous knowledge with my new training in technology.
